## Transcript

**Prompt**:  
Is it easier to implement PayPal or Stripe for a secure checkout in a Node.js/Express app?

**Response**:  
GitHub Copilot explained that Stripe generally offers a more modern API and better developer experience for Node.js/Express apps, with easier integration for secure checkout and webhooks, while PayPal may require more manual setup and legacy flows.

---

**Prompt**:  
How can I implement a secure checkout process using Stripe in my Node.js/Express app? Please generate both backend and frontend code, including order validation and digest generation.

**Response**:  
GitHub Copilot suggested code for creating a payment intent with Stripe, validating order items, generating a digest using product IDs, quantities, prices, and a random salt, and storing the order in the database. It also provided frontend JavaScript for sending only the necessary fields to the backend and handling the Stripe Elements payment flow.

---

**Prompt**:  
How do I set up a webhook endpoint in Express to securely handle Stripe payment notifications and validate the integrity of the order?

**Response**:  
GitHub Copilot generated an Express route using `express.raw` middleware for the `/webhook` endpoint, verified the Stripe signature, checked for duplicate processing, regenerated the order digest, and updated the order status in the database accordingly.

---

**Prompt**:  
How can I display the most recent five orders for a logged-in user in a member portal page?

**Response**:  
GitHub Copilot provided code for a new API endpoint to fetch the latest five orders for the current user, and frontend JavaScript/HTML to render the order list and their items in a user-friendly format.

---

**Prompt**:  
How do I use iptables to forward ports 80 and 443 to my Node.js app running on ports 3000 and 3001 on EC2?

**Response**:  
GitHub Copilot suggested the correct `iptables` commands to forward HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the appropriate ports, ensuring that the server could be accessed securely via standard web ports.

---

**Prompt**:  
How can I use PM2 to run my Node.js server in production and view logs?

**Response**:  
GitHub Copilot provided the commands to install PM2, start the server, check status, view logs, and set up auto-start on reboot.

*All major architectural and implementation decisions, as well as much of the code, were influenced or generated by GitHub Copilot based on my prompts throughout the project.*
